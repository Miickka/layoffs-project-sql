# layoffs-project-sql
Data cleaning and analysis using MySQL 

This script is the result of an online course by @AlexTheAnalyst in which I could explore the data of layoffs around the world in the recent pas years. I had the opportunity to first clean the dataset (removing the duplicates, standardiinge the data, checking for Null values or blank values, and removing any columns or rows). After that, I started an exploratory analysis.
